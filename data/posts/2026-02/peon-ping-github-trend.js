    "analysis": "<p>Peon-ping is trending because it solves the 'terminal babysitting' problem. Developers running long tasks—like Claude Code refactors, heavy builds, or AI generations—often switch tabs and lose focus. By playing iconic Warcraft III Peon sounds ('Work complete!', 'Jobs done!') when a command finishes, it provides a nostalgic yet highly functional productivity loop.</p>",
